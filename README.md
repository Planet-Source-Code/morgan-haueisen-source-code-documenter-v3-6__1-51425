### Description

(Updated 11/09/04) This application will give you a well-formatted printout that includes a cover page, a table of contents and a project summary. You can select what will be printed, from the entire project, a single procedure in a module, or just the project summary. You can send the output to the screen (preview) or the printer. You can also export the results to a RTF file, HTML file, or a bitmap file (using the preview). It also has some additional printing options to save paper. Includes a stand-alone version as well a VB add-in. It uses VB6's TreeView control, so it will not work with older version of VB. (Project's name change: was 'A Project's Source Code Printer).
